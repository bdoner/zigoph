Gopher runs on TCP/IP port 70.
Client --> Server --> Client
Server responses are terminated by a dot on it's own line.
Hieracy of documents, directories and services, much like a filesystem.
Server has no state.

Each item has:
    * A type
    * User visible name
    * selector string (to identify another item on the server) (can be empty)
    * host name the item recides on
    * port the host is listening on

selector string, host and port are required to fetch a resource.

A search item type is used by submitting a query to the search server, with the selector string and keywords to match in the request 


Sample conversations:
    Client: (opens connection)
    Server: (accepts connect)
    Client: <CR><LF> (list everything. aka an empty selctor string)
    Server:
